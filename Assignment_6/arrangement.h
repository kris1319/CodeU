    // Updates current state with the given ordering. It works in assumption that new_arrangement
    // vector is valid and it is possible to rearrange cars to get a new ordering.
    //
    // Algorithm. The main idea is to consider arrangements as the permutations.
    // Assume that we have two arrangements - current [a1, a2, ..., aN] and new [b1, b2, ..., bN], thus:
    //
    // * transition is a connection between 2 nodes (or 2 cars) v and u such are:
    //   current[v_new_idx] = u, where v_new_idx - index of the vth car in the new arrangement;
    //
    // * chain is a sequence of transitions [v1 -> v2 -> ... -> vK -> 0];
    //
    // * cycle is a sequence of jumps [v1 -> v2 -> ... -> vK -> v1];
    //
    // where v1, ..., vK - different nodes (i.e. cars), and 0 is an empty slot. For example:
    //
    // * if [1 2 0] - current, [0 1 2] - new then 1 -> 2 -> 0 is a chain
    //
    // * if [1 2 3 0] - current, [2 3 1 0] - new then 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 1 is a cycle
    //
    // Also let's notice important facts: if we have
    // * a cycle with size K this cycle can be rearranged by K + 1 steps (simple actions),
    // * a chain with size K it needs K steps to rearrange the chain.
    // And these numbers of actions are the only possible minimums.
    // In this way the minimum possible number of steps for rearranging N cars is N.
    //
    // Also it is important that any possible arrangement can be factorized on the set of chains and
    // cycles even if the size of chain/cycle is 1.
    // The main idea of the method is to traverse two given arrangements (current and new) by chains and
    // cycles and recursively rearrange each chain and each cycle.
    //
    // Complexity.
    // On each chain/cycle the algorithm call itself recursively and after move current node (car) to
    // the empty slot where the car should be in the new arrangement.
    // One movement contains deleting busy slot and insert new one into the unordered_set of empty slots.
    // Thus the complexity of one movement is constant - O(1). Assume that the number of cycles is K.
    // Thus it takes O(N + K) to rearrange the cars. So K is less then N thus total complexity is O(N).
